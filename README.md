# 3D-printed_UFO_Reactors
This repository contains all relevant files for 3D printing our custom photoreactors.

These photoreactor designs have been investigated as reported in "Open-Source 3D Printed Reactors for Reproducible Batch and Continuous-Flow Photon-Induced Chemistry: Design and Characterization" (published in Reaction Chemistry & Engineering, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1039/d4re00081a).

In this repository you will find all the files required to build your photochemical reactors for Kessil lamps. Autodesk Inventor 2022 has been used to design the different parts, educational access is available for most universities. The files can be modified and adapted to the specific needs of the laboratory. The STL files are also provided and can be directly sliced and 3D printed through softwares like CURA (Ultimaker) or PrusaSlicer (Prusa). 

- The UFO system is a fully 3D printed batch photochemical reactor that can accomodate 4, 8 or 12 reaction tubes at the same time (diameter: 16 mm) The top cover 4 vial is specially designed to be modified. After opening the file, in "Manage" and "Parameters":
	- Vial_radius can be changed to fit larger/smaller reaction tubes
	- Vial_number can be changed to fit more tubes (up to 16 have been tested succesfully)
	- Vial_number_cap can be changed to fit longer tubes and avoid them to touch the bottom of the reactor

- The Uflow system is a fully 3D printed flow photochemical reactor directly translated from the UFO as it is designed for one Kessil lamp oriented vertically. The reactor coil can be equipped with a variety of tubing to obtain different reactor volumes.

- The Fidget reactor is a partially 3D printed flow photochemical reactor. It is designed to obtain an increased irradiation with 3 Kessil lamps. Simulations have been performed to obtain an homogeneous irradiation at the surface of the reactor coil. 

We encourage everyone to use, modify, adapt and share the designs for their needs!
